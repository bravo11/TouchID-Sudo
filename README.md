# TouchID-Sudo

### This is a simple script to automate adding touchID as a sufficient authentication method for sudo commands on mac with Touch ID. Since ï£¿ won't just include it officially, we must resort to these hacky measures. 

This script will create a backup of the sudo pam file whenever it edits it and it will only edit the file if touchID is not already found. 

Should this bork your system, simply copying the `sudo.bak` file over the modified `sudo` file from a recovery shell should do the trick.

## Installation 

1. Place the bash script iteslf anywhere you like.
2. Edit `com.user.addtouch.plist` and replace `/usr/local/bin/addTouch.sh` with wherever you placed the script in step 1 above.
3. Place `com.user.addtouch.plist` file in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`
4. Make sure the `addTouch.sh` script is executable.
